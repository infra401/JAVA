What is a Programming Language ?
- Humans use natural language (like hindi/english) to communicate.
- Computers only understand 0/1 or on/off

- Giving instructions to a computer
- Instructions: Tells computer what to do
- These instructions are called code
- Human instructions are given in High level languages

- Compiler converts high level languages to low level machine code.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************
What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************
What is Syntax?
- Structure of words in a sentence.
- Rules of the language
- For programing exact syntax must be followed.

History of Java
- Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (Early 1990s)
- Originally named 'Oak', later renamed Java in 1995
- First Release (1995): Introduced "Write Once, Run Anywhere" concept with cross-platform compatibility.

- Developed with vision of backward compatibility. Should not break with new version release.

- Rapid Growth and Diversification (Late 1990s - 2010s): Expanded from web applets to server-side applications;
  standardized into different editions for various computing platforms.

How Java Changed the Internet?
- Portability with Write Once Run Anywhere
- Security because

Java Buzzwords:

Robust
Java is robust due to its strong memory management, exception handling, and type-checking
mechanisms which help in preventing system crashes and ensuring readble performance.

Multithreading
Multithreading in programming is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing for
more efficiency, processing and task management.  


Architecture Neutral
Java is architecturally neutral because its compiled code (bytecode) can run
on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying
hardware architecture.

Interpreted and High Performance
Java combines high performance with interpretability, as its bytecode
is interptreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which employs Just-In-Time (JIT)
compilation for efficient and fast execution.

Distributed
Java is inherently distributed, designed to facilitate network-based application development 
and interaction, seamlessly integrating with Internet, protocols and remote method invocation.
